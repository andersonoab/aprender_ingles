Our love lived in quiet moments.
You held my hand like forever.
We promised to never say goodbye.
I see your smile in every sunrise.
Your laughter still echoes in my soul.
Time changed us, but not my heart.
You are the memory I never let go.
Even the silence remembers you.
We built dreams on broken streets.
Your kiss stayed on my skin.
I can still taste yesterday.
You were my first and only.
Every goodbye still feels like the first.
We said forever under the stars.
You left, but love stayed.
I remember us in faded photos.
That summer lives in my veins.
You’re the reason my heart still aches.
Love like ours doesn’t fade.
We lost each other, not the feeling.
We ran away from time itself.
I still keep your letters close.
We never needed words.
I would do it all again.
Your name lives in my breath.
The music stopped, but I still dance.
We were fire in a cold world.
I loved you with no fear.
You were the calm in my storm.
Even now, I wait for you.

You were my unfinished song.
Our story still plays in my mind.
We kissed like we had no tomorrow.
No one understood us but us.
Love like ours rewrites time.
You left your shadow in my heart.
Sometimes I still walk our street.
The nights are longer without you.
We were too perfect to last.
You made forever feel real.
I whisper your name in the dark.
We said goodbye, but I never meant it.
The stars remember our secrets.
You taught me how to feel.
Our love still burns, silently.

You’re still my hardest goodbye.
I wish you knew how much you mattered.
Even distance couldn’t erase you.
We were a spark in the dark.
You’re the reason I still believe.
The world moved on I didn’t.
I see us in other people’s smiles.
My soul still calls your name.
We said goodbye with our eyes.
I still carry pieces of you.
You were a chapter I never closed.
Your voice is my favorite sound.
We were poetry in motion.
You were the only one who saw me.
I remember the way you looked back.
We grew older, but love didn’t.
I’d give anything for one more day.
You were the calm before every storm.
Somewhere, we still exist.
Your goodbye was never complete.
I still love you in silence.
Our hearts still know the way.
You live in every sad song.
You’re the reason I write at night.
Even now, I wait by the phone.
You were my beginning.
You’re my favorite memory.
If I had the chance, I’d never let go.
You are the ghost I welcome.
